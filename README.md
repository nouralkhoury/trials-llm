# Trials LLM biomarker Predict

## Overview
This repository systematically investigates the impact of varying prompt engineering and fine-tuning strategies on different Large Language Models (LLMs) for the prediction of inclusion and exclusion genetic biomarkers. The study is conducted across diverse cancer clinical trials training dataset sizes to assess and optimize model performance.
